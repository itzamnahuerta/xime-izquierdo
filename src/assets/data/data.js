I used to think, “my childhood was rotten, you wouldn’t want to be me, you wouldn’t want my life” until I realized the function of trials and tribulations, I realized the value of falling flat on your face only to get up and move on another 10 years, then another 10 more, and then some more until I merged with music, performing the reforming of my ROYGBIV refractions into one ominous beam of light. The pain of not having a father, of not understanding why I always felt out of place, of feeling so divorced from my sense of self ceased to exist when I realized that everything I needed to express nature had already been given to me. The Matriarch is my foundation, and from there I've built my legacy through art and deed. I express evolution because  Nature Allows Evolution.`

He took the photo from below so my ass was the focal point and said “I want you to see you how I see you.” He laughed and so did I, in an effort to hide my discomfort (a habit I’m working to break.) I don’t know if he understood or would understand objectification in romantic relationships to be harmful. I don’t know that he would see the link between persistent objectification and the belief that value is primarily based on physical appearance, or the negative effect that has on a person’s sense of self/worth, but I heard these words as final confirmation that he was incapable of affirming me in other ways just as regularly.



    Here I am, on the rooftop of my friend’s apartment overlooking the place I was born, in the fog of a recent break up, somewhere between grief and relief, feeling seen as I see myself for the first time in a long time. Thank God for friends who see you and show you who you are; friends who reflect you back to yourself.`

    y la nostalgia.
    Personas que se entre-acogieron para cuidarse y cultivarse.
    hermanas ramas de un resistente árbol tropical que echó raíz en la tundra.

What does it mean to hold each other up, to moved together in the silence of communication? I felt you shiver, us quack and acclimate. Found shelter in our finger tips and puddles of run off that held our collective steps, skins cells and molecules together.

A strictly gendered child, the most binary of binaries is what their Mami demanded of them. They still wear the scars from these words used to described women like them, “marimacha”, “tortillera”.

That’s the moment Ximena took that photo, it’s been a year to be exact, and so many things have changed our lives, many lives have changed forever. I could not imagine the things that were gonna happen, all I knew is that i needed to return back home and be back in my bed. I needed to be back with my friends in Mexico City, that’s where I live now. 

    Yo creo que la vida cambio demasiado, que te diría a ti socia…lo primero que te diría es que no dejes de hacer el trabajo que estas haciendo, no dejes de tejer alianzas, las cuales me están ayudando a mi a crecer como persona y como mujer pero también estoy aprendiendo a conocer otras vidas y a otras hermanas a través del trabajo que se esta haciendo. Nunca pensé que el trabajo que estoy haciendo fuera a ser reconocido, pero ya en este momento, ya ni me interesa. Me interesa mas ser reconocida por mi comunidad, mis hermanas, y aquellos los cuales he escogido que sean parte de mi vida como tu Ximena. Gracias gracias por darme alojo las veces que he llegado a Nueva York, gracias por darme alojo en tu casa, gracias por las platicas que hemos tenido en tu cocina. 
    
    Lo único que te puedo decir Sofia es que la vida va a cambiar mucho, y una tiene que ser fuerte.  
    
    I want to recognize the efforts of so many people now, and then to make a better trans future, not only for ourselves but for others. Even under these circumstances, our community, my trans community will make space and time to thrive because we deserve a better future for us, as elder women for our younger generation, seeking hope in such a time of uncertainty or I just cannot imagine living a life without any physical contact as a young adult.
    
    I want to tell myself that things are going to be better, and that I shouldn’t give up and I should continue doing the work that I do. I’m playing a little bit of rancheras cause that’s how I feel, it’s a day after a new moon. 
    
    I wanna encourage more people to remind yourselves that life has some strange surprises and that we should just continue to live our lives and those with privilege to give us a little bit of access and recognize that we exist and that we are trying hard to be afloat and survive in such a chaotic time. 
    
    Gracias Ximena, for taking this photo and reminding me that in a year so many things can change, and I’m actually beyond excited for the future. For my future. For the trans future. For our queer future that we are building together, thank you, I hope to see you soon and hug you again.`

		personalNote: `Halloween 2019. I dressed as Rue from Euphoria. In the first season of the show, they never explicitly name Rue’s gender or sexuality. Queer characters are allowed complexity in that their queerness is not the driving force behind their character arc, though it is acknowledged and certainly part of the plot. Rue falls in love with Jules and they’re queer but it’s not a “coming out story.” I think Rue’s gender is referenced once when Jules dresses them and says, “I like the way I dressed you but I’m worried I fucked with your gender expression.” That moment reminded me of the intentional decision I made to look for looser-fitting clothing years ago, before I felt comfortable asking anyone to use they/them pronouns when referring to me. I see my own gender and sexuality reflected in Rue. I see myself before I had the words “queer” or “non-binary” or “fluid” as descriptors and I like to imagine what it’d be like not to feel the need to define or disclose those identities; to live in a world where queerness doesn’t require explanation. `
