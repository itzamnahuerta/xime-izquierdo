</h1>\n            <p>\n              Growing up my mom wouldn’t let anyone sit on my bed. She said it was a sacred place. When friends came over we would have to sit in the living room with her watching nearby. As I grew, it became clear to me how differently we felt about sacredness. As a teenager looking for mirrors, searching for family, I lived in many homes. For a long time, I was too shy to take photographs of the people around me. I took lots of pictures of our things, the living room my roommates and I shared, the bathroom where we got ready to face a world that hated us, kitchens, beds, windows. Almost 3 years ago, I started taking portraits of my chosen family. It started as an archive for me, to remind myself of the incredible beings that have surrounded me, nurtured me and loved me in ways that I sometimes wasn’t even ready for. I started asking if I could take my fam’s portraits. It’s a big responsibility you see, to capture a second of those that have been your siblings and your mothers when you were still trying to figure out what family meant. In a moment in which extraction is so present in our communities, this series Se Que Fue Así Porque Estuve Allí (I know it was so, I was there) has been my way of loving on my chosen family. Of showcasing the beauty that I am held by and that I see in my most intimate moments with all of my fierce, gorgeous, Black & Brown, queer and trans kin. It is our lives that are sacred, the ways in which we see ourselves, and each other, the ways we allow ourselves and each other to be. I see every portrait in this series as a portrait of myself as well, because I was there. \n            </p>\n            <p> \n              [This project is by artist Xime Izquierdo Ugaz and commissioned by El Museo del Barrio for ESTAMOS BIEN: LA TRIENAL 20/21 curated by Elia Alba, Susanna Temkin, and Rodrigo Moura.]\n            </p>\n        \n          <button id=\"btn-icon\" onClick={this.props.handleArtistStatement} > \n            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M0 3.795l2.995-2.98 11.132 11.185-11.132 11.186-2.995-2.981 8.167-8.205-8.167-8.205zm18.04 8.205l-8.167 8.205 2.995 2.98 11.132-11.185-11.132-11.186-2.995 2.98 8.167 8.206z\"/></svg>\n          </button>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n","const data = [\n  {\n    portrait: \"Akir with Roses for Pink Bandanazz\",\n    className: 'child dogwhisperer',\n    location: \"Brooklyn\",\n    date: \"April, 2019\",\n    imgUrl: \"https://res.cloudinary.com/canelaconpan/image/upload/v1597540043/Akir_with_roses_for_Pink_Bandanazz_Brooklyn_April_2019_ukcned.png\",\n    audioUrl: \"https://res.cloudinary.com/canelaconpan/video/upload/v1597596043/xime/audio/Akir_with_roses_for_Pink_Bandanazz_Brooklyn_April_2019_efe25s.mp4\",\n    personalNote: \"The person in this portrait has, for the first time, been met with pure kindness\"\n  },\n  {\n    portrait: \"Alfie in the corset\",\n    className: 'child ',\n    location: \"Brooklyn\",\n    date: \"March, 2019\",\n    imgUrl: \"https://res.cloudinary.com/canelaconpan/image/upload/v1597542856/xime/Alfie_in_the_corset_Brooklyn_March_2019_r0ejss.png\",\n    audioUrl: \"https://res.cloudinary.com/canelaconpan/video/upload/v1597596030/xime/audio/Alfie_in_the_corset_Brooklyn_March_2019_cfwnwl.m4a\",\n    personalNote: \"Una persona intuitiva sintiendo que tiene una comprensiÃ³n profunda de los demÃ¡s y un sentido natural de lo que sucede detrÃ¡s de la escena.

In this photo that person is joyful, hopeful, happy, excited, in love with the world that they had created through their music and anxious as they wanna make sure that they will always continue to fuse reality with other galaxies, other worlds, to fuse the way that they're living with their dreams, with their reality, to make those dreams tangible not some far away world in some far away existence.\"\n  },\n  {\n    portrait: \"Jess and Lolu in the morning\",\n    location: \"Brooklyn\",\n    date: \"September, 2019\",\n    imgUrl: \"https://res.cloudinary.com/canelaconpan/image/upload/v1597543993/xime/Jessica___Lolu_in_the_morning_Brooklyn_November_2019_cpinca.png\",\n    audioUrl: \"https://res.cloudinary.com/canelaconpan/video/upload/v1597596043/xime/audio/Jess___Lolu_in_the_morning_Brooklyn_November_2019_cxcqsq.m4a\",\n    personalNote: \"She is open, untangling, un-learning and re-learning.

I needed to be back with my friends in Mexico City, thatâ€™s where I live now. \n\n    Yo creo que la vida cambio demasiado, que te dirÃ­a a ti sociaâ€¦lo primero que te dirÃ­a es que no dejes de hacer el trabajo que estas haciendo, no dejes de tejer alianzas, las cuales me estÃ¡n ayudando a mi a crecer como persona y como mujer pero tambiÃ©n estoy aprendiendo a conocer otras vidas y a otras hermanas a travÃ©s del trabajo que se esta haciendo. Nunca pensÃ© que el trabajo que estoy haciendo fuera a ser reconocido, pero ya en este momento, ya ni me interesa. Me interesa mas ser reconocida por mi comunidad, mis hermanas, y aquellos los cuales he escogido que sean parte de mi vida como tu Ximena. Gracias gracias por darme alojo las veces que he llegado a Nueva York, gracias por darme alojo en tu casa, gracias por las platicas que hemos tenido en tu cocina. \n    \n    Lo Ãºnico que te puedo decir Sofia es que la vida va a cambiar mucho, y una tiene que ser fuerte.  \n    \n    I want to recognize the efforts of so many people now, and then to make a better trans future, not only for ourselves but for others. Even under these circumstances, our community, my trans community will make space and time to thrive because we deserve a better future for us, as elder women for our younger generation, seeking hope in such a time of uncertainty or I just cannot imagine living a life without any physical contact as a young adult.\n    \n    I want to tell myself that things are going to be better, and that I shouldnâ€™t give up and I should continue doing the work that I do. Iâ€™m playing a little bit of rancheras cause thatâ€™s how I feel, itâ€™s a day after a new moon. \n    \n    I wanna encourage more people to remind yourselves that life has some strange surprises and that we should just continue to live our lives and those with privilege to give us a little bit of access and recognize that we exist and that we are trying hard to be afloat and survive in such a chaotic time. \n    \n    Gracias Ximena, for taking this photo and reminding me that in a year so many things can change, and Iâ€™m actually beyond excited for the future. For my future. For the trans future. For our queer future that we are building together, thank you, I hope to see you soon and hug you again.`\n  },\n  {\n    portrait: \"Sonny at his temporary home\",\n    location: \"Brooklyn\",\n    date: \"January, 2019\",\n    imgUrl: \"https://res.cloudinary.com/canelaconpan/image/upload/v1597546180/xime/Sonny_at_his_temporary_home_Brooklyn_January_2019_jz2v3b.png\",\n    audioUrl: \"https://res.cloudinary.com/canelaconpan/video/upload/v1597596045/xime/audio/Sonny_at_his_temporary_home_Brooklyn_January_2019_r9rywj.m4a\",\n    personalNote: `I would describe the person in the photo\n    as me.

I dressed as Rue from Euphoria. In the first season of the show, they never explicitly name Rue’s gender or sexuality. Queer characters are allowed complexity in that their queerness is not the driving force behind their character arc, though it is acknowledged and certainly part of the plot. Rue falls in love with Jules and they’re queer but it’s not a “coming out story.” I think Rue’s gender is referenced once when Jules dresses them and says, “I like the way I dressed you but I’m worried I fucked with your gender expression.” That moment reminded me of the intentional decision I made to look for looser-fitting clothing years ago, before I felt comfortable asking anyone to use they/them pronouns when referring to me. I see my own gender and sexuality reflected in Rue. I see myself before I had the words “queer” or “non-binary” or “fluid” as descriptors and I like to imagine what it’d be like not to feel the need to define or disclose those identities; to live in a world where queerness doesn’t require explanation. `\n  },\n  {\n    portrait: \"Vianca overlooking the city\",\n    location: \"Brooklyn\",\n    date: \"November, 2019\",\n    imgUrl: \"https://res.cloudinary.com/canelaconpan/image/upload/v1597546567/xime/Vianca_overlooking_the_city_Brooklyn_July_2019_btiw4x.png\",\n    audioUrl: \"https://res.cloudinary.com/canelaconpan/video/upload/v1597596045/xime/audio/Vianca_overlooking_the_city_Brooklyn_July_2019_paipeo.m4a\",\n    personalNote: `A few days before this photo was taken, my then soon-to-be ex took a photo of me at the beach.

I don’t know if he understood or would understand objectification in romantic relationships to be harmful. I don’t know that he would see the link between persistent objectification and the belief that value is primarily based on physical appearance, or the negative effect that has on a person’s sense of self/worth, but I heard these words as final confirmation that he was incapable of affirming me in other ways just as regularly.\n\n\n\n    Here I am, on the rooftop of my friend’s apartment overlooking the place I was born, in the fog of a recent break up, somewhere between grief and relief, feeling seen as I see myself for the first time in a long time.

She said it was a sacred place. When friends came over we would have to sit in the living room with her watching nearby. As I grew, it became clear to me how differently we felt about sacredness. As a teenager looking for mirrors, searching for family, I lived in many homes. For a long time, I was too shy to take photographs of the people around me. I took lots of pictures of our things, the living room my roommates and I shared, the bathroom where we got ready to face a world that hated us, kitchens, beds, windows. Almost 3 years ago, I started taking portraits of my chosen family. It started as an archive for me, to remind myself of the incredible beings that have surrounded me, nurtured me and loved me in ways that I sometimes wasn’t even ready for. I started asking if I could take my fam’s portraits. It’s a big responsibility you see, to capture a second of those that have been your siblings and your mothers when you were still trying to figure out what family meant. In a moment in which extraction is so present in our communities, this series Se Que Fue Así Porque Estuve Allí (I know it was so, I was there) has been my way of loving on my chosen family. Of showcasing the beauty that I am held by and that I see in my most intimate moments with all of my fierce, gorgeous, Black & Brown, queer and trans kin. It is our lives that are sacred, the ways in which we see ourselves, and each other, the ways we allow ourselves and each other to be. I see every portrait in this series as a portrait of myself as well, because I was there. \n      <br/> <br/>\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"commision-desc\">This project is by artist Xime Izquierdo Ugaz and commissioned by El Museo del Barrio for ESTAMOS BIEN: LA TRIENAL 20/21 curated by Elia Alba, Susanna Temkin, and Rodrigo Moura.</p>\n        \n      <button id=\"btn-icon\" onClick={props.handleLandingPage} > \n      \n      <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M0 3.795l2.995-2.98 11.132 11.185-11.132 11.186-2.995-2.981 8.167-8.205-8.167-8.205zm18.04 8.205l-8.167 8.205 2.995 2.98 11.132-11.185-11.132-11.186-2.995 2.98 8.167 8.206z\"/>  \n        </svg> \n      </button>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default LandingPage","import React, {Component} from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\nimport Main from './components/Main';\nimport LandingPage from './components/LandingPage';\n\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    this.state = {\n      displayLandingPage: true\n    }\n  }\n\n  handleLandingPage = () => {\n    if( this.state.displayLandingPage === true ) {\n      this.setState({ displayLandingPage: false})\n    } else if ( this.state.displayLandingPage === false) {\n      this.setState({ displayLandingPage: true})\n    }\n  }\n\n\n  render() {\n      if(this.state.displayLandingPage === true) {\n        return (\n          <React.Fragment>\n          <LandingPage \n                handleLandingPage={this.handleLandingPage} \n            />\n          </React.Fragment>\n        )\n      }\n      return (\n        <div className=\"App\">\n              <Main  />\n        </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
