</h1>\n            <p>\n              Growing up my mom wouldn’t let anyone sit on my bed. She said it was a sacred place. When friends came over we would have to sit in the living room with her watching nearby. As I grew, it became clear to me how differently we felt about sacredness. As a teenager looking for mirrors, searching for family, I lived in many homes. For a long time, I was too shy to take photographs of the people around me. I took lots of pictures of our things, the living room my roommates and I shared, the bathroom where we got ready to face a world that hated us, kitchens, beds, windows. Almost 3 years ago, I started taking portraits of my chosen family. It started as an archive for me, to remind myself of the incredible beings that have surrounded me, nurtured me and loved me in ways that I sometimes wasn’t even ready for. I started asking if I could take my fam’s portraits. It’s a big responsibility you see, to capture a second of those that have been your siblings and your mothers when you were still trying to figure out what family meant. In a moment in which extraction is so present in our communities, this series Se Que Fue Así Porque Estuve Allí (I know it was so, I was there) has been my way of loving on my chosen family. Of showcasing the beauty that I am held by and that I see in my most intimate moments with all of my fierce, gorgeous, Black & Brown, queer and trans kin. It is our lives that are sacred, the ways in which we see ourselves, and each other, the ways we allow ourselves and each other to be. I see every portrait in this series as a portrait of myself as well, because I was there. \n            </p>\n            <p> \n              [This project is by artist Xime Izquierdo Ugaz and commissioned by El Museo del Barrio for ESTAMOS BIEN: LA TRIENAL 20/21 curated by Elia Alba, Susanna Temkin, and Rodrigo Moura.]\n            </p>\n        \n          <button id=\"btn-icon\" onClick={this.props.handleArtistStatement} > \n            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"><path d=\"M0 3.795l2.995-2.98 11.132 11.185-11.132 11.186-2.995-2.981 8.167-8.205-8.167-8.205zm18.04 8.205l-8.167 8.205 2.995 2.98 11.132-11.185-11.132-11.186-2.995 2.98 8.167 8.206z\"/></svg>\n          </button>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n","const data = [\n\t{\n    portrait: 'Midrene with roses',\n    className:\"c1\",\n\t\tlocation: 'Brooklyn, New York',\n\t\tdate: 'December, 2017',\n\t\timgUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://res.cloudinary.com/canelaconpan/image/upload/v1597544965/xime/Midrene_with_roses_Brooklyn_December_2017_gncgjf.png',\n\t\taudioUrl:\n\t\t\t'https://res.cloudinary.com/canelaconpan/video/upload/v1597596043/xime/audio/Midrene_with_roses_Brooklyn_December_2017_spl4kk.m4a',\n\t\tpersonalNote:\n\t\t\t'The person in this portrait is off her game and has been caught slipping.

My whole life I've turned the detritus of life into gold; divine masculine. I used to think, “my childhood was rotten, you wouldn’t want to be me, you wouldn’t want my life” until I realized the function of trials and tribulations, I realized the value of falling flat on your face only to get up and move on another 10 years, then another 10 more, and then some more until I merged with music, performing the reforming of my ROYGBIV refractions into one ominous beam of light. The pain of not having a father, of not understanding why I always felt out of place, of feeling so divorced from my sense of self ceased to exist when I realized that everything I needed to express nature had already been given to me. The Matriarch is my foundation, and from there I've built my legacy through art and deed.

I dressed as Rue from Euphoria. In the first season of the show, they never explicitly name Rue’s gender or sexuality. Queer characters are allowed complexity in that their queerness is not the driving force behind their character arc, though it is acknowledged and certainly part of the plot. Rue falls in love with Jules and they’re queer but it’s not a “coming out story.” I think Rue’s gender is referenced once when Jules dresses them and says, “I like the way I dressed you but I’m worried I fucked with your gender expression.” That moment reminded me of the intentional decision I made to look for looser-fitting clothing years ago, before I felt comfortable asking anyone to use they/them pronouns when referring to me. I see my own gender and sexuality reflected in Rue. I see myself before I had the words “queer” or “non-binary” or “fluid” as descriptors and I like to imagine what it’d be like not to feel the need to define or disclose those identities; to live in a world where queerness doesn’t require explanation. `\n\t},\n\t{\n    portrait: 'Zion in Chinatown',\n    className:\"c19-r3\",\n\t\tlocation: 'Mahanttan, New York',\n\t\tdate: 'December, 2019',\n\t\timgUrl: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/canelaconpan/image/upload/v1597546568/xime/Zion_in_Chinatown_Manhattan_December_2019_inhfug.png',\n\t\taudioUrl: null,\n\t\tpersonalNote:\n\t\t\t'I would describe this person as a girl who’s traveling outside of her comfort zone.

She said it was a sacred place. When friends came over we would have to sit in the living room with her watching nearby. As I grew, it became clear to me how differently we felt about sacredness. As a teenager looking for mirrors, searching for family, I lived in many homes. For a long time, I was too shy to take photographs of the people around me. I took lots of pictures of our things, the living room my roommates and I shared, the bathroom where we got ready to face a world that hated us, kitchens, beds, windows. Almost 3 years ago, I started taking portraits of my chosen family. It started as an archive for me, to remind myself of the incredible beings that have surrounded me, nurtured me and loved me in ways that I sometimes wasn’t even ready for. I started asking if I could take my fam’s portraits. It’s a big responsibility you see, to capture a second of those that have been your siblings and your mothers when you were still trying to figure out what family meant. In a moment in which extraction is so present in our communities, this series Se Que Fue Así Porque Estuve Allí (I know it was so, I was there) has been my way of loving on my chosen family. Of showcasing the beauty that I am held by and that I see in my most intimate moments with all of my fierce, gorgeous, Black & Brown, queer and trans kin. It is our lives that are sacred, the ways in which we see ourselves, and each other, the ways we allow ourselves and each other to be.
