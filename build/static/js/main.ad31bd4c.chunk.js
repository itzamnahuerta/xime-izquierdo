She said it was a sacred place. When friends came over we would have to sit in the living room with her watching nearby. As I grew, it became clear to me how differently we felt about sacredness. As a teenager looking for mirrors, searching for family, I lived in many homes. For a long time, I was too shy to take photographs of the people around me. I took lots of pictures of our things, the living room my roommates and I shared, the bathroom where we got ready to face a world that hated us, kitchens, beds, windows. Almost 3 years ago, I started taking portraits of my chosen family. It started as an archive for me, to remind myself of the incredible beings that have surrounded me, nurtured me and loved me in ways that I sometimes wasn\u2019t even ready for. I started asking if I could take my fam\u2019s portraits. It\u2019s a big responsibility you see, to capture a second of those that have been your siblings and your mothers when you were still trying to figure out what family meant. In a moment in which extraction is so present in our communities, this series Se Que Fue As\xed Porque Estuve All\xed (I know it was so, I was there) has been my way of loving on my chosen family. Of showcasing the beauty that I am held by and that I see in my most intimate moments with all of my fierce, gorgeous, Black & Brown, queer and trans kin. It is our lives that are sacred, the ways in which we see ourselves, and each other, the ways we allow ourselves and each other to be.

It was like a surge of electricity that she sent through me, and she said, this is this is where you will begin to heal. And that was the end of the dream, I never have remembered anything like that in my life, I've never remembered a dream like that, I've never...I remember it so fresh. And, I woke up and I was really upset, I was so upset, I was crying and I was so sad, because I felt like I'd never see her again.

She said it was a sacred place. When friends came over we would have to sit in the living room with her watching nearby. As I grew, it became clear to me how differently we felt about sacredness. As a teenager looking for mirrors, searching for family, I lived in many homes. For a long time, I was too shy to take photographs of the people around me. I took lots of pictures of our things, the living room my roommates and I shared, the bathroom where we got ready to face a world that hated us, kitchens, beds, windows. Almost 3 years ago, I started taking portraits of my chosen family. It started as an archive for me, to remind myself of the incredible beings that have surrounded me, nurtured me and loved me in ways that I sometimes wasn\u2019t even ready for. I started asking if I could take my fam\u2019s portraits. It\u2019s a big responsibility you see, to capture a second of those that have been your siblings and your mothers when you were still trying to figure out what family meant. In a moment in which extraction is so present in our communities, this series Se Que Fue As\xed Porque Estuve All\xed (I know it was so, I was there) has been my way of loving on my chosen family. Of showcasing the beauty that I am held by and that I see in my most intimate moments with all of my fierce, gorgeous, Black & Brown, queer and trans kin. It is our lives that are sacred, the ways in which we see ourselves, and each other, the ways we allow ourselves and each other to be.
